# Matrix Operations

A Python script that demonstrates basic matrix operations on 2x2 matrices, including addition, multiplication, and transposition.

## Features
- Matrix addition
- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix transposition
- Example matrices for demonstration
- Functions for each operation

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script: `python matrix_operations.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## What It Does
- Defines two example 2x2 matrices (A and B)
- Performs and displays:
  - A + B (addition)
  - A * B (multiplication)
  - Transpose of A
- Uses list comprehensions for matrix operations

## Example Output
```
Matrix A:
[1, 2]
[3, 4]

Matrix B:
[5, 6]
[7, 8]

A + B:
[6, 8]
[10, 12]

A * B:
[19, 22]
[43, 50]

Transpose of A:
[1, 3]
[2, 4]
```

## Customization
- Modify the example matrices in the `main()` function to test with different values.
- Extend the functions to handle matrices of different sizes.
